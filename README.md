# User Management System - Access Control

### Overview

This repository is part of the **Access Control System** aimed at providing secure and scalable management for smart doors, key cabinets and other security devices. The entire project is divided into three separate systems:

1. **User Management System (this repo)**
2. **Resource Management System**
3. **Access Management System**


### What is Access Control?
Access control is a critical component in security systems, used to regulate who can use, or access resources in a computing environment. In this project, the Access Control System manages permissions and credentials for users to ensure only authorized individuals can access key resources, such as key cabinets or restricted areas.

The **User Management System** is responsible for handling the creation, management, and authentication of users within the access control ecosystem. It ensures that user data, roles, and permissions are securely stored and easily managed.

### Technologies Used
<li> Java 17 with Spring Boot
<li> PostgreSQL (database management)
<li> JWT (authentication)
<li> Docker (containerization)
<li> Azure (deployment and cloud services)
